## Lab 4

### App Description
In this final update, I added transition animations between cards and the editing screen, as well as a small animation when flipping bewteen card sides. 
The answer side was also given a separate color to help distinguish it from the question side and the buttons on the buttom screen were re-adjusted for clarity.
